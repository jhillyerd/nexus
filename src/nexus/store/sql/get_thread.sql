-- One stored thread row (lazy hydration of a dormant thread). The
-- provenance columns ride along (utility-tags plan §3.5): rehydration
-- must never lack them. bot_id is the bots plan's provenance pointer
-- (NULL = created without a bot; display only, never request bytes).
-- toolset is the bots plan P2 snapshot: the resolved names hydration
-- resolves through the config-independent catalog (loud failure on a
-- name absent from the compiled code).
